Ranged weapons do fixed damage as listed in the @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor02gear00.JournalEntryPage.02gearnotes00000]{Gear} section. Most pistols, for example, cause 2d6 damage.</p> <p>Hand weapons cause damage equal to the attacker’s @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor01charac.JournalEntryPage.01traits00000000]{Strength} die plus a second die, which depends on the weapon. A barbarian with a d12 Strength and a long sword (d8 damage) rolls d12+d8 damage.</p> <p>Even though Strength is used to determine melee damage, this isn’t a @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor01charac.JournalEntryPage.01traits00000000]{Trait} roll so @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03wildcardsand00]{Wild Cards} don’t add a Wild Die to the roll.</p> <p>All damage rolls can Ace.</p> <p><strong>Unarmed Damage: </strong>An unarmed combatant rolls only his Strength die unless he has an @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor01charac.JournalEntryPage.01edges000000000]{Edge} like <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Brawler]{Brawler} </strong>or <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Martial Artist]{Martial Artist}</strong> that grants him a damage die.</p> <h3>Bonus Damage</h3> <p>Well-placed attacks are more likely to hit vital areas, and so do more damage. If your hero gets a raise on his attack roll (regardless of how many raises), he adds +1d6 to the final total. Bonus dice can also Ace!</p> <p>Bonus damage applies to all attacks, including @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor05powers.JournalEntryPage.05powers00000000]{spells} and @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03areaeffectat00]{area effect} weapons.</p> <h3>Applying Damage</h3> <p>If the damage roll is less than the target’s @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor01charac.JournalEntryPage.01characters0000]{Toughness}, the victim is beaten up a bit but there’s no game effect. If the damage is equal to or greater than his Toughness, he’s @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03damageeffect00]{Shaken}.
