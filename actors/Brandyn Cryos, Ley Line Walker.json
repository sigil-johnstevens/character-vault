He observed as a group of Cyber-Knights—recently arrived from the Tolkeen war—were belittled, taunted, and ultimately being drawn into a one-sided fight against demons and undead. Though one of the knights was a woman he’d had a less-than-friendly encounter with years ago (Lady Kyla Foster), he could not stand by and allow the murder of her and her companions in the streets. Helping them effect their escape, he was offered another option, and now the Tomorrow Legion has his service.

Tied directly to the earth-shattering weave of ley\n    lines, nexuses, and Rifts covering the planet, Walkers are masters of the\n    unleashed arcane powers that indisputably redefined existence.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    The Walker’s study of ley lines doesn’t just represent raw magical might,\n    though they have plenty of that. Ley Line Walkers are highly sought after by\n    scholars, leaders, and explorers because of their unrivaled knowledge and\n    understanding of the lines of power that tore the world asunder and opened the\n    way to countless other realms.\n  </p>\n<img alt=\"a leyline walker in light armor with a flowing red cape powering up a spell in their left hand\" class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/swrifts-tlpg/assets/art/38-leyline-walker.webp\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/swrifts-tlpg/assets/art/38-leyline-walker.webp')\" />\n<h4>Hero’s Journey (Two Rolls)</h4>\n<p>\n    Walkers gain one roll on any of the following tables:\n    <strong>@Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-tables.Enchanted Items and Mystic Gadgets Benefits Table]{Enchanted Items and Mystic Gadgets}</strong>,\n    <strong>@Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-tables.Education Benefits Table]{Education}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-tables.Experience and Wisdom Benefits Table]{Experience and Wisdom}</strong>, and\n    <strong>@Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-tables.Magic and Mysticism Benefits Table]{Magic and Mysticism}</strong>.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    They also get one roll on <em>any</em> table of their choice, except for\n    <strong>@Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-tables.Psionics Benefits Table]{Psionics}</strong>.\n  </p>\n<h4>Walk the Line</h4>\n<span class=\"SingleSource_TLPG-Walk_The_Line\">\n<p>\n    Ley Line Walkers spend the majority of their lives in and around ley lines.\n    Not only does this lead to vast knowledge of these phenomena, such a life\n    bestows considerable gifts of unique power upon the Walker. Walkers can\n    interact with ley lines in a way few others ever manage. They draw far more\n    power from them than other arcane practitioners, can levitate and float along\n    them, sense and read the lines thoroughly, communicate up and down the lines,\n    and even heal more quickly when along one.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Though a Walker is a capable spellcaster almost anywhere she is found, she\n    always tries to orient conflicts on or near a ley line where her power is at\n    its greatest.
