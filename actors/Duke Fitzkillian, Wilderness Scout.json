Exploiting that bond resulted in a soldier created to serve the\n    Coalition in its war against the supernatural. The misuse of this relationship\n    galls many, but they needn’t bother explaining to the typical Dog Boy; he\n    won’t care, he’s just happy to serve!\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Most Dog Boys—officially known as Psi-Hounds—serve the Coalition States in the\n    military or security forces. They don’t enjoy the same rights as humans, yet\n    are generally treated well by those who command them. Most Coalition Grunts\n    have only love and respect for the Dog Boys, who throw themselves fearlessly\n    into any fray, prepared to die to protect their humans.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Dog Boys encountered outside Coalition service are considered “feral” by the\n    CS, to be put down on sight. They represent the isolated instances where\n    constant abuse or an awakened conscience drove the being to reject the\n    Coalition. More and more common are the “free born,” Dog Boys born in the wild\n    away from CS societal controls.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Despite the name, not all Dog Boys are male. Factors such as size, coloration,\n    and features depend heavily upon which breed of canine the Dog Boy is adapted\n    from. The variety of Dog Boys is impressive, as the scientists responsible for\n    creating them experimented extensively (and still do) to create specialized\n    breeds for particular tasks and operational demands.\n  </p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar float-right\">\n<h4>Mutant Animals</h4>\n<div>\n<p>\n      Near the end of what historians refer to as the Golden Age, in the days\n      before a terrible war brought about the Coming of the Rifts, one of the more\n      dramatic advances in genetics and biological sciences was the advent of\n      forcibly evolved animals. Enhancements to intelligence brought sapience to\n      the minds of creatures like cats, apes, and especially dogs.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      One of the key facilities, located in the former state of Texas, was\n      discovered and reconstructed by the Coalition States. Now the Lone Star\n      Complex continues the work of experimenting upon and “upgrading” animals to\n      serve the Coalition.
