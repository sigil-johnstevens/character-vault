But many of those going under the knife for the bio-comp\n    and other implants to convert them into the most potent super-soldiers in the\n    world might think it is. They often spout nihilistic phrases like, “Live fast,\n    die young, and leave a great-looking corpse!” Most of them might even mean it\n    at the time.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Inevitably, they come to understand differently as their short years pass by\n    in a haze of bullets and blood, and their lives burn away faster and faster.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    A Juicer sells his most precious commodity—his very existence on the\n    planet—for the gifts of chemical enhancement through nanotech augmentation,\n    all managed and moderated by an internal bio-comp system. Speed, strength, and\n    endurance 10 times that of a top athlete make a Juicer a powerful combat\n    machine. He trades his natural lifespan to become a killing machine, rented to\n    the highest bidder or committed to an ideal that matters more than his own\n    life.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    In many cases, he does it just to see that his family gets a decent, safe\n    place to live and three square meals a day.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Whatever the reason, the Juicer is a powerful and dangerous being for a few\n    short years at best, and then he’s either dead or (in very, <em>very</em> rare\n    cases) a shattered husk of a person yearning for glory forever lost.\n  </p>\n<h4>Hero’s Journey (TWO Rolls)</h4>\n<p>\n    Juicers gain one roll on any of the following tables:\n    <strong>@Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-tables.Body Armor Benefits Table]{Body Armor}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-tables.Close Combat Weapons Benefits Table]{Close Combat Weapons}</strong>,\n    <strong>@Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-tables.Ranged Weapons Benefits Table]{Ranged Weapons}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-tables.Training Benefits Table]{Training}</strong>, and\n    <strong>@Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-tables.Underworld and Black Ops Benefits Table]{Underworld and Black Ops}</strong>.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Juicers gain one additional roll on any table except for those dealing with\n    magic or psionics.\n  </p>\n<h4>The Burn</h4>\n<img alt=\"A woman in space commando gear aiming a rifle with a red-sight attachment\" class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/swrifts-tlpg/assets/art/35-juicer.webp\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/swrifts-tlpg/assets/art/35-juicer.webp')\" />\n<span class=\"SingleSource_TLPG-The_Burn\">\n<p>\n    Living life to its fullest takes on a special meaning for the Juicer. There’s\n    an unreliable timer ticking away in his system, and when it goes off, the very\n    chemicals and hormone overdrive nano-systems that make him a demigod burst his\n    heart or send his brain into a fatal stroke. Until that time, however, the\n    Juicer can often do more impossible things before breakfast than others\n    accomplish in a lifetime.\n  </p>\n<p>\n<strong>Burn Rating:</strong> Juicers have a special Burn Rating statistic.\n    Burn Rating measures both the short lifespan of a Juicer and his capacity for\n    superhuman feats. In a standard campaign, a Juicer’s Burn Rating begins at\n    eight (for very short campaigns or one-shots it might start at six or four,\n    respectively). As Burn Rating decreases over time—there is no method known to\n    replenish it—the Juicer senses his days growing closer to being truly\n    numbered. At the same time, he can call upon this same quality, Burning\n    Bright, to perform astounding, nigh-impossible exploits.\n  </p></span>\n<h4>Burning Bright</h4>\n<aside class=\"sidebar float-right\">\n<h4>Burn Out or Fade Away</h4>\n<div>\n<span class=\"SingleSource_TLPG-Burn_Out\">\n<p>\n      If a Juicer seeks detox, he has to find a surgeon willing to try and who has\n      the facilities to pull it off. Castle Refuge has such facilities, as do most\n      high-tech cities with Juicer technology. After removing the bio-comp and the\n      Juicer bonus to Vigor, the hero makes a @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03traitrolls0000]{Vigor check} at −2 if he has 5+ Burn\n      remaining, or −4 with 4 or less Burn remaining. If he fails, he dies. On a\n      success, it takes a full month before he’s physically able to function; with\n      a raise, he only needs a week.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      After the operation, he must make a @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03traitrolls0000]{Spirit check} at the same penalty. A\n      Critical Failure means he is far too despondent and crushed to carry on\n      meaningfully. From this point forward he's incapable of adventuring as\n      a player character. With failure, he can carry on, but gains the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-hindrances.Habit]{Habit}\n      (Major) Hindrance and retains the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-hindrances.Death Wish]{Death Wish} Hindrance. With success, the\n      character has broken his physical addiction but retains the Death Wish\n      Hindrance. With a raise, he’s found his way past both the cravings and\n      psychological loss and is ready to start afresh.\n    </p>\n<p>\n      Losing the bio-comp and the chemicals means the Juicer loses all Iconic\n      Framework abilities and complications (with the possible exception of Death\n      Wish), and is considered a @UUID[Compendium.swrifts-tlpg.rifts-tlpg.rifttlpg01charac.JournalEntryPage.01mars0000000000]{MARS} character from now on (but gets no extra\n      chart rolls, abilities, skills, etc.).

Ranged weapons do fixed damage as listed in the @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor02gear00.JournalEntryPage.02gearnotes00000]{Gear} section. Most pistols, for example, cause 2d6 damage.</p> <p>Hand weapons cause damage equal to the attacker’s @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor01charac.JournalEntryPage.01traits00000000]{Strength} die plus a second die, which depends on the weapon. A barbarian with a d12 Strength and a long sword (d8 damage) rolls d12+d8 damage.</p> <p>Even though Strength is used to determine melee damage, this isn’t a @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor01charac.JournalEntryPage.01traits00000000]{Trait} roll so @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03wildcardsand00]{Wild Cards} don’t add a Wild Die to the roll.</p> <p>All damage rolls can Ace.</p> <p><strong>Unarmed Damage: </strong>An unarmed combatant rolls only his Strength die unless he has an @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor01charac.JournalEntryPage.01edges000000000]{Edge} like <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Brawler]{Brawler} </strong>or <strong>@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Martial Artist]{Martial Artist}</strong> that grants him a damage die.</p> <h3>Bonus Damage</h3> <p>Well-placed attacks are more likely to hit vital areas, and so do more damage. If your hero gets a raise on his attack roll (regardless of how many raises), he adds +1d6 to the final total. Bonus dice can also Ace!</p> <p>Bonus damage applies to all attacks, including @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor05powers.JournalEntryPage.05powers00000000]{spells} and @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03areaeffectat00]{area effect} weapons.</p> <h3>Applying Damage</h3> <p>If the damage roll is less than the target’s @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor01charac.JournalEntryPage.01characters0000]{Toughness}, the victim is beaten up a bit but there’s no game effect. If the damage is equal to or greater than his Toughness, he’s @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03damageeffect00]{Shaken}.
