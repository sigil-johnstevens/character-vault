Like Juicers, they accept dramatic\n    augmentations to mind and body in exchange for exceptional power and\n    capabilities.

True or not, there’s no denying mental\n    instability becomes part of the daily existence for any recipient of the\n    treatment.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    According to sketchy historical records, the original technology leading to\n    Mind Over Matter (more commonly referred to as M.O.M.) implants first appeared\n    in South America during the last years before the Coming of the Rifts.\n    Initially intended for the treatment of mental disorders, scientists\n    discovered that nanotechnology could be used to rewire mind and body to\n    perform at superhuman levels.
