Some can’t help but start the fire.\n    Bursters are highly passionate people, given to extreme emotions and\n    expressions, and this dramatically affects the way their powerful psionic\n    energies manifest.\n  </p>\n<img alt=\"Imagine you can burst into flames and not have to worry about needing a new suit each time.

Their capabilities extend far beyond that\n    foundation, however, in that they can also affect existing combustion, slowing\n    it down or even stopping it entirely. Fire is theirs to create, command, and\n    cancel as they see fit.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    As @Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-edges.Major Psionic]{Major Psionics}, Bursters also have access to other psionic abilities,\n    making them formidable in more than open combat.

Scholars speculate this\n    relationship—which sometimes manifests as anthropomorphizing and speaking to\n    flames—is a mechanism of focus, helping the psionic control an otherwise\n    highly volatile process. Intertwining mind and spirit with the flames creates\n    a feedback loop that further enhances the Burster’s abilities.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    In addition to flinging powerful bolts of fire and manipulating combustible\n    processes over an area, some Bursters are able to read and understand\n    everything there is to know about a particular fire, even when it’s no longer\n    active. These Bursters can study the site of a fire, sifting through the ashes\n    and observing the burn patterns, and describe in great detail what started it,\n    how it burned, and what brought it to an end.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Unsurprisingly, Bursters are utterly impervious to heat and fire in any form.\n    Lightning and electricity have limited effects on them as well, since the heat\n    and burning aspects of such energy are of little concern.\n  </p></span>\n <h4>An Energetic Mind</h4>\n<span class=\"SingleSource_TLPG-Burster_An_Energetic_Mind\">\n<p>\n    Though pyrokinesis is the mainstay of a Burster, she also has access to a\n    strong array of other psionic powers.
