This is the legacy every Glitter Boy pilot lives under.\n    Most try to live up to it, some fail, and a rare few never even try, using the\n    power of the suit to become tyrants and thieves.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Those who uphold the heroic tradition come from a long line of Glitter Boy\n    pilots, earning the iconic power armor suit from a previous owner (a parent,\n    mentor, or friend). They grow up hearing the stories of how the Glitter Boys,\n    created and blessed by the superheroic Neemans, strode forth into the fiery\n    storms to save what they could of humanity. As the dragons and demons and\n    machines of terror poured forth from the Rifts to destroy or enslave what\n    remained of the human species, the Glitter Boys stood alone for long years to\n    hold back the tide of total apocalypse.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Eventually, allies stood beside them, including the Cyber-Knights and others\n    with the power to make a difference. The collective consciousness of humanity,\n    however, never forgets their current existence is thanks to those\n    10-foot-tall, glittering suits of godlike armor.\n  </p>\n<img alt=\"Imagine an shining, metallic grey exoskeletal(it covers all parts) suit you can pilot that can go toe to toe with dragons and demons of ancient lore.

This is one of the\n    key features of the armor; even vehicle-grade lasers tend to bounce off it.\n    Virtually all firearms are repelled since the Glitter Boy has the highest MDC\n    rating of any known power armor, tougher even than many robot vehicles many\n    times its size. It also has enormous strength-enhancement technology,\n    excellent mobility and speed, and even an aquatic performance mode.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    The wearer enjoys full life support conditions, including feeding tubes, water\n    supply, and waste processing, providing acceptable living conditions for up to\n    four weeks if needed. This is far from comfortable, and a pilot remaining in a\n    suit longer than 72 hours risks serious muscle atrophy and other issues. After\n    three days in the suit, the pilot must make a @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03traitrolls0000]{Vigor check} each day to avoid\n    gaining a @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03fatigue0000000]{Fatigue} level (he does not, however, risk @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03fatigue0000000]{Exhaustion} or worse). A\n    full day out of the suit restores this Fatigue. Regardless of this challenge,\n    if the choice is death or stay in the suit, a month’s survival time is good to\n    have available.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    The Glitter Boy has all the standard Power Armor features including advanced\n    communications (20-mile range, or 500 miles with access to a dedicated relay\n    system), a full sensor suite with HUD (Heads Up Display) readouts—granting +2\n    on all Notice checks and incorporating 360 degree radar, thermal imaging, and\n    night vision, optics enhancement with 50× magnification—audio pickups capable\n    of hearing whispers at 100 yards, and onboard combat computers and targeting\n    systems that offset two points of Shooting penalties.\n  </p>\n<span class=\"SingleSource_TLPG_Boom_Gun\">\n<h4>One Big Damn Gun</h4>\n<p>\n    The primary design of the Glitter Boy armor is, of course, to provide\n    protection for the wearer in combat conditions. Of nearly equal importance in\n    the design is the capacity to carry and operate the <br />RG-14 Rapid\n    Acceleration Electromagnetic Rail Gun. Unlike the rail guns of modern design\n    and function, this “antiquated” weapon sacrifices extended rate of fire for\n    sheer, unadulterated obliteration of a target area with a hail of metal nearly\n    impossible to imagine in scope and speed.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Called the Boom Gun for very good reason, the RG-14 may be the single loudest\n    man-portable weapon in the world. It emits a sonic boom of such intensity, no\n    one nearby is safe without good ear protection and sealed armor. The Glitter\n    Boy suit employs a pair of laser-tipped pylons which drill down 4.5 feet from\n    the heel of each leg, combined with toe-hooks and metal prongs extending from\n    the ends of the drills. At the same time, a jet engine system activates on the\n    upper back of the suit, working with the pylons to ensure stability while\n    firing the scariest gun on Earth.\n  </p>\n </span>\n<h4>Glitter Boy Abilities and Bonuses</h4>\n<p>\n    The Glitter Boy is truly king of the battlefield.
