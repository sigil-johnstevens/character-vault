None epitomize this idea more openly and\n    spectacularly than the psi-sword-wielding Cyber-Knights.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Take any noble warrior tradition—steeped in matters of honor, justice, and\n    mercy—and it is a valid model upon which a Cyber-Knight may base his life.\n    Though most tend to walk a path founded on the romantic ideals of Western\n    Europe (especially as imagined for the heroic knights of legend), there are\n    Cyber-Knights representative of almost any culture known on Earth, as well as\n    more than a few from places far, far away.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    The foundations are simple yet inviolate for those who gain the gifts of the\n    calling. Sadly, in the wake of the Fall of Tolkeen (a terrible event that\n    @UUID[Compendium.swrifts-tlpg.rifts-tlpg.rifttlpg00introd.JournalEntryPage.00theworldaswe00]{split the Order of the Cyber-Knights nearly in half}), there are\n    plenty of those fallen from the path, yet no less dangerous for it.\n  </p>\n<h4>Hero’s Journey (TWO Rolls)</h4>\n<p>\n    Cyber-Knights gain one roll on any of the following tables:\n    <strong>@Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-tables.Education Benefits Table]{Education}</strong>, <strong>@Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-tables.Experience and Wisdom Benefits Table]{Experience and Wisdom}</strong>,\n    <strong>@Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-tables.Psionics Benefits Table]{Psionics}</strong>, and <strong>@Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-tables.Training Benefits Table]{Training}</strong>.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Cyber-Knights gain one roll on <em>any</em> table except\n    <strong>@Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-tables.Cybernetics Benefits Table]{Cybernetics}</strong> and <strong>@Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-tables.Magic and Mysticism Benefits Table]{Magic and Mysticism}</strong>.\n  </p>\n<h4>A History of Honor and Glory</h4>\n<p>\n    No one is sure how or when the Cyber-Knights first appeared, though it’s\n    almost certain they arrived during the Dark Ages after the Rifts. Most legends\n    maintain a human knight from another world, Lord Coake, took up the cause of\n    defending innocents against the horrors of this ravaged world and trained\n    others to follow his ways.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Although he respected individual beliefs and ways of life, he insisted on some\n    core principles to which all Cyber-Knights must adhere. These include\n    fairness, nobility, valor, honor, courtesy, and loyalty. Each Cyber-Knight\n    interprets these to varying degrees, but at the core of their behavior, each\n    must abide by the overall principles to remain a member of the Order.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Because of this, Cyber-Knights are honored, respected, and cherished\n    throughout the world, even by many who have cause to call them enemies.\n  </p>\n<i>For example, the Coalition States officially consider Cyber-Knights enemies\n    of the state, but the average CS trooper is unlikely to raise a hand against\n    one except under duress. Similarly, only the most evil and corrupt citizens of\n    the Federation of Magic would openly attack a Cyber-Knight.</i>\n<h4>What’s the “Cyber” About?</h4>\n<p>\n    One of the great mysteries for the average person is just why the\n    Cyber-Knights are called such. They have no obvious cybernetics; in fact they\n    eschew them to maintain a certain physical perfection. Even their prized\n    cyber-armor is something of a misnomer as it actually manifests from the same\n    nanotech which provides their cyberkinetic power.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    When a squire ascends to knighthood, he undergoes a combination ritual and\n    medical process that embeds a specialized form of semi-organic nanotech into\n    his body. Many scholars believe this may have come from Lord Coake’s\n    homeworld, though time has erased all evidence and only the innermost circle\n    of the Order knows the truth.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    In addition to creating an organic metal shell, the nanotech gives the warrior\n    exceptional gifts to combat foes wielding technology. An experienced\n    Cyber-Knight can take on an entire platoon of well-armed CS troops and handily\n    defeat them as their devices glitch and fail, thanks to his passive and active\n    powers.\n  </p>\n<h4>An Inner Light</h4>\n<p>\n    Another part of the Cyber-Knight’s training centers on unlocking not only\n    psionic potential, but also spiritual strength. These two qualities combine to\n    give him a distinct advantage, especially against supernaturally evil foes.\n    The most obvious and potent symbol of this training is the Psi-Sword, a blade\n    of the knight’s own personal configuration, made purely from the force of his\n    spirit and will. He can also manifest other aspects similar to this power with\n    more experience and training.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Cyber-Knights are also Minor Psionics, with a specific list of powers they\n    train to use. Due to the spiritual focus of their psionic training,\n    Cyber-Knights start with the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Champion]{Champion} Edge, and they may take the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Holy/Unholy Warrior]{Holy Warrior}\n    Edge using @Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-edges.Arcane Background (Psionics)]{Arcane Background (Psionics)} in place of @Compendium[swrifts-tlpg.rifts-edges.Arcane Background (Miracles)]{Arcane Background (Miracles)} to qualify (with the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Psionics]{Psionics} skill replacing @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Faith]{Faith}).
