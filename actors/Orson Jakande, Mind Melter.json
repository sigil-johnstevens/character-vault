Even the ones with a more noble or gentle intent fully grasp just\n    how terrifying their powerful minds are.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Mind Melters are masters of psionic energies and their uses. There is no\n    practical limit to what they are capable of with enough experience and\n    training. To them, the energies of every mind create a tapestry depicting the\n    past and the future, as well as all possible present moments, and they can\n    grab any thread they like, tug it out of order, and re-thread it as they will.\n  </p>\n<p>\n    Some use this power for benevolent purposes, trying to defend the weak and\n    make the world a better place.
